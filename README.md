# Vidify-Blog-to-video-converter-AI
" Vidify â€“ AI based Blog to Video Converter " aims to streamline  the process of summarizing lengthy blogs by transforming them into concise video  extracts. This solution  addresses the challenge by automatically generating summarized videos in MP4  format from blog URLs, presenting the key points through images and text  overlays. 

The system works by leveraging GPTscripts to analyze and extract the 
most relevant content from the blog. Important ideas, headlines, and critical 
insights are distilled into a short, readable format. The summarized text is further 
enriched with visuals to enhance comprehension and engagement. FFmpeg, a 
multimedia framework, is used for seamless video generation and processing, 
ensuring that the final output is both lightweight and high-quality.


This project holds significant potential in content curation, making information 
consumption quicker and more efficient. Users can gain insights from lengthy 
articles within a fraction of the time, promoting better retention through visual 
storytelling.

The "Vidify" is not only practical for individual users but also for 
content creators, marketers, and educators seeking to deliver summarized 
information in an easily digestible video format.
